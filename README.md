# ðŸ”¥ Northern Nevada Wildfires Analysis

## ðŸ“˜ Summary

This project explores the increasing frequency, intensity, and impacts of wildfires in Northern Nevada. By leveraging public datasets, we analyze historical wildfire occurrences and assess their relationship with climate factors, particularly temperature. The results provide insight into trends over time and offer data-driven recommendations for fire mitigation strategies.

The work supports community understanding and decision-making around wildfire risks and is part of the broader mission of [Truckee Meadows Tomorrow](https://www.truckeemeadowstomorrow.org) to enhance quality of life through accessible data.
